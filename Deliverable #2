Design concepts
Sketch a number of significantly different design concepts. The envisioned interaction with the system should be understandable from each sketch with at most a minimal amount of accompanying text. Note that your team can select a subset of your sketches to demonstrate a sufficient diversity of design concepts you explored.

Prototypes
Document the prototypes that you developed to explore competing design decisions, making sure that a reader can understand how the prototypes are "used" during testing.

Usability goals and benchmark tasks
Decide on the most relevant usability goals for your system and choose appropriate "benchmark tasks" that you will use to determine whether these goals are met.
