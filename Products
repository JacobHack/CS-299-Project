Tone Indicators in Text Messages:
-Some articles and resources suggest using tone indicators, symbols, or shorthand at the end of text messages to convey tone. While this is a workaround, it has several limitations:
-It relies on the sender's ability to remember and consistently use tone indicators, which can be prone to human error.
-It doesn't provide real-time analysis or automated assistance in interpreting the tone of incoming messages.
-It doesn't offer customization options for how messages are presented or displayed.
Tone Indicator Lists:
-There are websites that compile lists of tone indicators, which users can reference to understand the emotional context of certain symbols or shorthand. However, these lists are passive resources and don't directly integrate with messaging apps.

Based on our research we have been unable to find any other proposed solutions or attempts at solving this issue. We did stumble upon several examples of something called a tone indicator list.

the Tone Indicator List. 
A tone indicator is a symbol or shorthand word used to convey the tone of a text-based message.
To use a tone indicator, users would insert a slash followed by a specific abbreviation at the end of their sentence.
The use of text or a symbol after your message has potential to cause major confusion when attempting to use.
For example, since the indicator comes after your message, the user will not know the tone of the message during the time it takes them to reach the end of the message not finishing the message or not reading the whole message can have the same effect.
However, if the entire message was color coded, then the tone of the message is expressed to the user right away â€“which eliminates unnecessary confusion.
