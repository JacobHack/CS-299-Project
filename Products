Tone indicators list

Based on our research we have been unable to find any other proposed solutions or attempts at solving this issue. We did stumble upon several examples of something called a tone indicator list.
Comparing products: 
One Example of a related product we found was the Tone Indicator List. 
A tone indicator is a symbol or shorthand word used to convey the tone of a text-based message
To use a tone indicator, users would insert a slash followed by a specific abbreviation at the end of their sentence.
The use of text or a symbol after your message has potential to cause major confusion when attempting to use.
For example, since the indicator comes after your message,
the user will not know the tone of the message during the time it takes them to reach the end of the message
not finishing the message or not reading the whole message can have the same effect.
However, if the entire message was color coded, 
then the tone of the message is expressed to the user right away â€“which eliminates unnecessary confusion.
