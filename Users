# User Observations and Personas

Observing Users:
Observe several users carrying out the activity you've chosen to focus on for your project. Describe your observations of these users as they carried out the specific activity.
When participants engage in text conversations, it is very telling in their reactions whether or not they have any difficulties in understanding the message tones.
Document instances where users misinterpret or struggle with the tone of messages.
Writing messages on different post-its and taking note of what the userâ€™s reactions were or how easy it was to understand the tone or meaning behind the message


Developing personas: 
Based on your observations, formulate one or more personas (or "audience segments") that describe the different types of people who will benefit from the project you are proposing. Include the intermediate results of your work in transforming your observations into personas.
Create personas like "Sarah, a college student with ADHD," who might struggle with interpreting sarcasm.
"John, a middle-aged professional," who may find it challenging to understand slang or emojis used by younger individuals.

Illustrating a use case scenario: 
Provide a story about how one of your personas would perform their task with your proposed system. The scenario should describe the important user actions and system reactions (the expected interaction) in reasonable detail, and convincingly demonstrate the use of the proposed system to address the user's need.
Imagine a scenario where "Sarah" receives a sarcastic message from a friend. Show how she uses your proposed system to clarify the tone and respond appropriately.
Describe the steps she takes, such as selecting a color to convey the message's tone and using the system's analysis to confirm her interpretation.
