<h1>Prototype Ideas:</h1>


<p>
  1. We implement an additonal key on the keyboard that allows users to select a color for their messages similar to how there is a button to add emojis to messages. The key would be labled tone and would have a variety of color options for the user to choose from. The colors would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.
  <br>
  2. We have the option for color on a message appear when you hold down the send button and then you will be given a list color similar to how the effects on messages currently work on iphone. This would again be a list of colors called tones. Each of them would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.
  <br>
  3. We add a tone button when you press and hold to react to a message. This would prompt the user with a button under translate called tone and would give the user a list of color options that correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color after they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.
  <br>
  4. A option next to the digital touch button above the keyboard. This would take your already typed out message and display it in different colors based on what the program wants to suggest to you. On the right sider there would be a list of color options based on how likely it thinks your message fits the tone. The colors would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.

<h1>Usability Goals:</h1>
<p>
1. Our first goal is to be user-friendly. Being easy to understand, and easy to use is extremely important for any prototype. However, it is crucial for ours because it is intended for people of all ages and all ranges of technological experience. 
<br>
2. Another goal is to be consistent. We want to make sure that the same, and correct, tone is being conveyed from sender to recipient. This will reduce confusion amongst our users. Reducing confusion is very important, if not the most important thing when working with a communication system. 
<br>
3. Our next goal is to be accessible to all users. We want to allow the use of colors that are friendly to people who have color blindness and/or other vision afflictions. This is a combination of being both user-friendly and trying to avoid confusion for users with disabilities. 
</p>

<h1>Benchmark Tasks</h1>
<p>
1. We can test new users setting up the system for the first time, see if they are able to complete it, and then ask them for feedback afterward. This will help identify any universally confusing areas in the design. We will know when the benchmark has been hit when we can consistently get new users to have zero problems while setting up for the first time.
<br>
2. We will ask users to interact with another person using our system. We will know we hit the benchmark for our second goal when we can monitor the system interface and interactions within the system. Once elements of the user interface are consistent for all users, and at least 90% of user interactions are consistent in terms of input and output, then we will have completed this task.
<br>
3. We will ask color-blind users to communicate with others using our system. We will know we reached our benchmark goal for accessibility when we have at least 90% of users report no confusion or communication issues.
