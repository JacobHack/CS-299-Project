<h1>Project Description:</h1>

<p>The problem addressed in this project is that sometimes you canâ€™t get the tone of a text message when someone sends it to you. This can make it hard to know if people are being sarcastic or what emotions they are feeling when they send you the message. We want to address this problem by giving users the ability to color code their messages so that people can gauge the tone of the message. We would also potentially create a feature that would analyze the conversation and give the user its best guess on the tone of each message.</p>


<h1>Potential Prototype Ideas:</h1>

<ol>
  <li>We implement an additonal key on the keyboard that allows users to select a color for their messages similar to how there is a button to add emojis to messages. The key would be labled tone and would have a variety of color options for the user to choose from. The colors would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default. </li>
  <li>We have the option for color on a message appear when you hold down the send button and then you will be given a list color similar to how the effects on messages currently work on iphone. This would again be a list of colors called tones. Each of them would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.</li>
  <li>We add a tone button when you press and hold to react to a message. This would prompt the user with a button under translate called tone and would give the user a list of color options that correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color after they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.</li>
  <li>A option next to the digital touch button above the keyboard. This would take your already typed out message and display it in different colors based on what the program wants to suggest to you. On the right sider there would be a list of color options based on how likely it thinks your message fits the tone. The colors would correspond with various tones such as sarcasm, anger, etc. This would allow the user to select the tone color before they send the message. They would also have the option to not select a color and leave it as default.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Additional Ideas:</h1>

<ol>
  <li>We are potentially interested in making it so that people can select which color they want to respresent each emotion on their messages.</li>
  <li>We are considering adding some programming that would try to recommend a color based on the conversation similar to auto complete on messages.</li>
  <li>We want to give people the option to disable this feature if they feel that would be better for them and then none of the messages would appear colored for them. </li>
</ol>


  
<h1>Description of intended user population:</h1>

<p>Our intended user population is anyone who may have difficulty communicating with others via text message. This includes but is not limited to, neurodivergent users, generational gaps between users, and anyone else who may have difficulties understanding tones in messages. Although our system could potentially be more helpful to these users it can be used by anyone with the goal of making their messages easier to understand.</p>

<h1>An explanation of why you think that you could develop a prototype solution with a relatively modest amount of implementation effort:</h1>

<p>We believe that developing a system that allows users to color code messages would not be that difficult given our current knowledge of python. However we do think their may be some limitations in our ability to actually implement our system into current messaging systems. Our goal is to test the prototype and then if it succesful and people find it useful then we can begin thinking about ways to implement it into already existing message systems. Our goal would be to initially create a program that allows users to change the color of messages based on tone. We would likely have this inside a contained enviroment and not attached to larger messaging applications. If this was succesful we would then look to expand it and potentially apply it to existing messaging services.</p> 

<h1>A brief overview of any existing solution (if there are) and what aspects you are improving upon:</h1>

<p>To our knowledge there is not any existing system that uses color to indicate tone in messages. There are other ways of indicating tone using tone indicators such as /j or /srs but none of these use color in their implementation.</p>

<h1>A summary of the software, hardware, and other skills that you expect to need in team members to accomplish the project:</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Python Scripts</li>
  <li>Some form of User Interface</li>
  <li>Github Pages</li>
  <li>A laptop or other computer to code on</li>
  <li>Communication with Users</li>
  <li>Basic Research Knowledge</li>
</ol>
